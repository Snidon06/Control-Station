control station 

A ready to use low level open source application for controling and monitoring various UAVs via radio comunucation through use of a radio transceiver on both client side and UAV side.

Overview

This project was originally created by joop brokking, but the codebase had significant issues that prevented it from running or meeting its intended goals.
I took over maintenance, diagnosed the problems, and implemented a series of fixes to restore full functionality. Note if you want the source code for it go to https://github.com/Snidon06/Control-Station(source)
